over medium high heat and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, approximately 30 minutes.\nRemove pot from the heat.\nRemove chicken quarters from the pot and transfer them to a cutting board and cool until they can be comfortably handled. \n \nRemove meat from the bones and chop it into small pieces then shred slightly; set aside.\nRemove approximately 1 cup (250ml) of the liquid from the stock pot and set aside.\nReturn the stock pot to medium heat and bring to a simmer. \n \nPlace the flour into a small bowl.\nWhile stirring constantly, gradually add the reserved liquid to the flour until a smooth paste is formed.\nPour the paste into the stock pot and stir constantly until the mixture starts to thicken.\nAdd the beans,

teaspoon cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes for a slightly hot flavor.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Rinse the chicken quarters really well and place them in a
