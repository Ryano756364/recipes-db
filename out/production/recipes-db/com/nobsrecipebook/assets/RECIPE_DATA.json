over medium high heat and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, approximately 30 minutes.\nRemove pot from the heat.\nRemove chicken quarters from the pot and transfer them to a cutting board and cool until they can be comfortably handled. \n \nRemove meat from the bones and chop it into small pieces then shred slightly; set aside.\nRemove approximately 1 cup (250ml) of the liquid from the stock pot and set aside.\nReturn the stock pot to medium heat and bring to a simmer. \n \nPlace the flour into a small bowl.\nWhile stirring constantly, gradually add the reserved liquid to the flour until a smooth paste is formed.\nPour the paste into the stock pot and stir constantly until the mixture starts to thicken.\nAdd the beans,

day but if you intend on freezing it, leave out the whipping cream and soured cream (they separate when frozen) and add them just before serving.\nIf youd like to spice things up a bit, add  -  teaspoon cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes for a slightly hot flavor.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Rinse the chicken quarters really well and place them in a
