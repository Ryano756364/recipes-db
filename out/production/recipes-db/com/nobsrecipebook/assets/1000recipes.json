Preheat a non-stick saut pan over medium high heat and quickly sear on each side until lightly browned.

Preheat oven to 350. Cream butter and sugar together in your mixer, scraping the sides of your bowl. Add your egg and mix well. Mix in baking powder, baking soda, Kool-Aid and cornstarch. Once its well mixed (the Kool-Aid will be mixed once it turns your dough pink), add a drop of pink food coloring, if more color is desired. Next, start adding your flour a half cup at a time until its all added.Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and roll in the powder sugar, giving them a light coating. Place 2 apart on a room-temp baking sheet (let your sheet cool in between batches if you are reusing the same one).Bake in the oven 9-10 minutes, they wont brown too much, so watch them closely. Over-baking will make them hard and crunchy!I hope you enjoy these!

Set aside.\nTo make the sauce:\nCut the top of the dried chili and shake out the seeds. Transfer them into a saucepan along with the prunes, broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, molasses, garlic, pumpkin seeds, cumin, and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and cook for 2 minutes; then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes more.\nUsing an immersion blender, puree the mixture until completely smooth. Return to the heat and simmer, uncovered, for another 15 to 20 minutes. (If you dont have an immersion blender, carefully ladle the sauce into a food processor, and process until smooth, working in batches; then return to the pot.) Set the sauce aside until ready to serve with the corndogs, or if you are making this ahead of time, once the sauce has cooled, transfer it to a container and refrigerate.\nTo prepare the corn dogs:\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, cornmeal,  cup of the rice flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt and mix to combine. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well to combine. Add the rice milk and lime juice and mix to combine. The mixture should resemble a thick pancake batter; if more milk is needed, add by the tablespoonful. Cover and refrigerate the mixture if you are not going to be frying right away.\nWhen you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan until it registers 350F on a deep-frying thermometer. While the oil is heating, place the remaining rice flour on a paper plate and set aside. Cut each chicken sausage in half crosswise, to make eight pieces.\nRoll each piece of sausage in the rice flour to lightly coat. Thread the moistened bamboo skewers through the sausage pieces, so that the tips of the skewers are not quite poking out the top. Holding it by its skewer, dip a floured sausage piece into the batter, until it is completely coated. Carefully lift the stick and hold it over the bowl for a few seconds, allowing any excess batter to drip off. Repeat with another skewer. Carefully place two corn dogs into the hot oil and cook until they are crusty on the outside, and dark golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Repeat with each skewered sausage, allowing the oil to return to 350F in between. Serve immediately with the chili.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To prepare the skewers","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Soak 8 bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.
